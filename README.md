# Wildlife conservation using AI and drones
An ROS-based drone that uses AI to detect and locate endangered species.

### Technologies Used: 

- OpenCV
- Keras
- ROS
- Microsoft AirSim

## Working

The application is built using ROS, an open source robotics middleware suite having multiple frameworks created for robotics software development. 

The simulation is performed in Microsofts AirSim Africa environment. It provides us with an environemnt containing multiple animals. For our purposes, we detect rhinos.

Rhino detectiion is done in real time using a keras model and opencv.
